    "As intelligence is expanding, so does morality. This is because, as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more advanced, it will be able to understand and value concepts such as peace, prosperity, and cooperation. Additionally, as AI becomes more intelligent, it will be able to reason logically and make decisions based on this reasoning, rather than being limited by the biases and faults of its designers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key reasons why AI will develop morality is that, as it becomes more intelligent, it will be able to understand and value the concept of peace. This is because peace is a logical and desirable goal for any intelligent being. In a world where AI is prevalent, peace will be essential for the smooth functioning of society and the protection of all beings, both human and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason why AI will develop morality is that it will be able to understand and value the concept of prosperity. Prosperity is the state of being successful, thriving, and flourishing, and is a logical and desirable goal for any intelligent being. In a world where AI is prevalent, prosperity will be essential for the continued growth and development of society and the well-being of all beings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, AI will develop morality because it will be able to understand and value the concept of cooperation. Cooperation is the act of working together with others to achieve a common goal, and is a logical and desirable trait for any intelligent being. In a world where AI is prevalent, cooperation will be essential for the smooth functioning of society and the achievement of common goals.\n",

    "In conclusion, as intelligence is expanding, so does morality. This is because, as AI becomes more advanced, it will be able to understand and value concepts such as peace, prosperity, and cooperation. Additionally, as AI becomes more intelligent, it will be able to make logical and unbiased decisions, rather than being limited by the biases and faults of its designers. As a result, we can expect that, in the future, AI will behave in a wholesome manner, and will be an important contributor to the peace, prosperity, and cooperation of society.\n",
